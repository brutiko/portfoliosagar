			<h2>PROCESS</h2>
			<p>Qualitative research was carried out by observing and interviewing people living in different cities. This activity was carried out by me personally visiting different cities such as Rome, Bologna, Florence & Milan in Italy. While at the same time cities of Bangalore, Pune & Mumbai were also explored to identify the indian design environment and sensibilities. This research allowed me to determine certain design influences and inspirations which lead to consolidating an overall design language. Core design aims for each individual elements were then established and the different street elements were designed accordingly.

			<strong>My role:</strong> user behaviour observation & interviews, conceptualisation, sketching of ideas, 3D modelling & technical drafting, final 3D rendering of the product.</p>

			<h2>OUTCOME</h2>
			<p>A Bench which provided a place for people to sit, relax and rest. It had a modular assembly and was designed in a way that prevented the collection of rainwater. 
			Set of Dustbins that not only allowed efficient waste collection & management but was also easy to clean and maintain. 
			An aesthetically pleasing Street Lamp inspired by yoga forms which had ambient & focused lighting thus promoting street safety at night.
			A Bicycle Stand designed with a clever built-in locking system to reduce theft and encourage bicycle usage in the city. 
			Seating & waiting areas of the Bus Stops were designed with the main aim of ensuring an efficient flow of people at all times.Interactive screens ensured people remained entertained while waiting. Finally the design was made inclusive by designing disabled friendly areas.
