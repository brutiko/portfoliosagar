			<h2>PROCESS</h2>
			<p>Different use-cases of people using a coffee table in a home setting were observed. Based on the user insight, several concepts were drawn up and a final idea was consolidated. The technical workings of the table was solved by developing of a custom-made magnetic pivot mechanism. The 1:1 working prototype of the table was made using flexible plywood.

			<strong>My role:</strong> user behaviour observation & interviews, conceptualisation, sketching of ideas, 3D modelling & technical drafting, final 3D rendering of the product, assisting in the manufacturing process of the first prototype.</p>

			<h2>OUTCOME</h2>
			<p>A flexible coffee table that can be expanded so that it is accessible to a small or large group of people. The magnetic-pivot mechanism of the table means it can be split up into its individual sections for a more personal & private use. The modular nature of the table allows it to be easily manufactured and transported. Overall, the design is contemporary, multi-functional, personal & playful.
